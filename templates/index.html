Room Wifi Service

<p>This would normally be a REST API for a CRM or other system, but this is just a demo!</p>
<p>This is a sample application that manages personal or room-based wifi networks for MDUs with Cisco Meraki.</p>
<p>The MDU might have a wifi AP per room/suite/apartment and a user staying in the room/suite/apartment could use this service to create their own wifi network.</p>
